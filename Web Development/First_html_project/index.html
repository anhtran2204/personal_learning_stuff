                <h2 id="para-title">What is hip hop?</h2>
                <p><strong>Hip hop</strong> or <strong>hip-hop</strong> is a culture 
                and art movement that was created by African Americans, Latino Americans 
                and Caribbean Americans in the Bronx, New York City. The origin of the name
                is often disputed. It is also argued as to whether hip hop started in the 
                South or West Bronx. While the term hip hop is often used to refer exclusively
                to hip hop music (including rap), hip hop is characterized four key 
                elements: <strong>"rapping"</strong> (also called MCing or emceeing), 
                a rhythmic vocal rhyming style (orality); <strong>DJing</strong> (and 
                turntablism), which is making music with record players and DJ mixers 
                (aural/sound and music creation); <strong>b-boying/b-girling/breakdancing</strong>
                (movement/dance); and <strong>graffiti</strong>. Other elements are: hip hop 
                culture and historical knowledge of the movement (intellectual/philosophical);
                beatboxing, a percussive vocal style; street entrepreneurship;
                hip hop language; and hip hop fashion and style, among others.
                The fifth element, although debated, is commonly considered either
                street knowledge, hip hop fashion, or beatboxing.</p>

                <p>Hip-hop provides a voice for an underrepresented
                group, as hip-hop artists use their music to comment on social and political 
                issues important to them and their culture. Hip-hop lyrics have also been 
                incorporated into curriculum to teach a variety of subjects, including creative
                writing assignments and poetry. A third way hip-hop can play a positive role is
                that it offers therapeutic benefits, such as rapport building between clients
                and therapists and fostering a sense of dependability and safety due to its
                repetitive and predicable nature. Additionally, hip-hop unifies its audience,
                which can allow it to connect communities around the world fighting the effects
                of discrimination, segregation and injustice. Finally, research has shown
                that hip-hop offers benefits to mental health in areas such as expressing
                emotion, coping and personal growth, which could lead to individual and
                community empowerment.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Proficiently applied data structures and algorithms, including 
                    stacks and recursion, to boost perclassmance by 65% while 
                    maintaining optimal compile and runtime efficiency.</li>
                <li>Collaborated effectively with remote team members to plan and 
                    address challenges related to computer architecture concepts 
                    such as pipelining and subroutines.</li>
                <li>Demonstrated strong research skills class self-learning advanced 
                    computer architecture concepts essential class project success.</li>

            <h3>Flight Plan Generator - Creator</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Employ Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm to efficiently compute 
                    and organize all accessible flight routes, subsequently presenting the 
                    most advantageous options, categorized by either cost or time considerations.</li>
                <li>The implementation also incorporates diverse data structures, including trees
                     and lists, strategically employed to manage specific data types, thereby 
                     enhancing the program's overall object-oriented design.</li>
